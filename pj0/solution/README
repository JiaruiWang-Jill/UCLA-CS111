The program 'pj0' includes the following files:
 - Makefile
 - README
 - lab0.c

The program takes the source code of shuf from GNU coreutils by Paul Eggerts
as a reference. Thank you, Paul.

The `make check` command performs a wide variety of tests, including:
 - writing to an output file that does not have read access
 - reading from an input file that does not have read access
 - reading from an input file that does not exist
 - having an invalid argument
 - reading from stdin and writing to stdout
 - reading from an input file and writing to stdout
 - reading from stdin and writing to an output file
 - reading from an input file and writing to an output file
