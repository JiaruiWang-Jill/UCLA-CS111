The program 'pj1b' includes the following files:
 - lab1a-server.c
 - lab1a-client.c
 - my.key
 - Makefile
 - README


the system handling was done through _c function.

This focus of this project is to use socket io to allow communication between
two processes. I did extensive research on how to use socket. This program also
contains a --debug option, which provides insight to how things works and helps
the process of testing.

I also manipulated the test script such that it gives out useful information.
For example, print out SVR_ERR and STD_ERR rather than sending them to
/dev/null. (but seriously though, why did you hide it from us...)

GDB is also partically helpful in this process, especially when an segfault
occurs.
