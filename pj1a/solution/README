The program 'pj1a' includes the following files:
 - Makefile
 - README
 - lab1a.c

This program contains a --debug option, which provides insight to how things
works and helps the process of testing.

the system handling was done through _c function.

The reason I submitted late is because I was mislead by this piazza post:
https://piazza.com/class/jxe8f0mifm5ef?cid=42
Looking back now I understand Diyu meant that the "--shell" option must be given
an option, not that the option itself is required. Hence I exited with failure
when the option is not provided.

The most frustrating thing is that the sanity test mislead me into thinking
there is some other problems. I keep getting the following test results:

... confiriming disable of ICANON
... ICANON still on (0x8a3b)
... confirming disable of ECHO
... ICANON still on (0x8a3b)
...
... confirming character at a time echo
FAIL ... STDERR dump follows:
EXPECTATION NOT FULFILLED
... confirming batch character echo and processing
FAIL ... STDERR dump follows:
EXPECTATION NOT FULFILLED

The first test failure are totally irrelavent. I spent a day looking at how come
the termios flags are not properly set, and it was desperating.

I hope this is a good enough reason to give me a slip day.

I worked very hard.
